//Question 42:Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39.
// Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians
// by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. 
//Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

let Magicians = ["Magicians1","Magicians2","Magicians3"];
function show_magicians(Magicians:string[]){
    Magicians.forEach(name => console.log(name))}

    function make_great(Magicians:string[]){
        for (let i = 0;i< Magicians.length; i++){
          console.log(Magicians[i] ="The Great  " +  Magicians[i])
        }
    }
    show_magicians(Magicians)
